# Eternity DLT

> **Private early-stage research into next-generation distributed-ledger technology**

Eternity DLT is an experimental initiative exploring scalable, secure and developer-friendly distributed-ledger primitives. Our work is currently conducted in private while we validate ideas and build out the core.

## At a glance

- **Performance-oriented, sustainability-minded** design  
- **Modular architecture** - consensus, execution, cryptography - built for extensibility  
- Gradual publication of concepts distilled from our internal **white-paper draft**  
- Public **testnet** live at [testnet.eternity.tn](https://testnet.eternity.tn)

## Status

This repository is **private-first**. Public milestones and source code will be shared once internal reviews are complete.
